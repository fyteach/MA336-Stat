## Learning goals

- Create and interpret boxplots as a means of summarizing non-symmetric data.

- Calculate and explain the purpose of measures of centers (mean, median), variability (standard deviation, interquartile range).

- Explain the impact of outliers on summary statistics such as mean, median and standard deviation.

## Median, Quartiles, Interquartile Range and Outliers

- The three **quartiles**, $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$ are numbers in an ordered data set that divide the data set into four equal parts. The second quartile is known as the **median**.

- **Interquartile Range (IQR for short)** is the measure of variation when using the median to measure center. It is defined as the difference of the third and the first quartiles: $\text{IQR}=Q_3-Q_1$.

- When the center and the spread are measured by the median and the IQR, a value in the data is considered an **outlier** if the value is
  - less than the lower fence $\text{fence}_{lower}=Q_1 − 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}$
   or
  - greater than the upper fence $\text{fence}_{upper}=Q_3 + 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}$.

  **Note:** An outlier in this definition is also called a **mild outlier**. An outlier that is less than the extreme lower fence $\text{extreme fence}_{lower}=Q_1 - 3 \cdot \text{IQR}$ or greater than the extreme upper fence $\text{extreme fence}_{upper}=Q_3 + 3 \cdot \text{IQR}$ is also called **extreme outlier**.

- The minimum, $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$ and maximum are known as the "**five-number summary**" of the data set.

- The difference of maximum and minimum is called the **range**.
  
---

## Example: Median, IQR and Outliers

Find the median, quartiles, IQR and outliers (if they exist) of the sample height of 15 trees.

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'} 
cat(paste(as.vector(head(trees$Height,15)), collapse=", "))
```
]

--

**Solution:**

- Sort the data set from small to large.
.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'} 
cat(paste(sort(as.vector(head(trees$Height,15))), collapse=", "))
```
]
- Find the median $Q_2$. The sample size is 15. The middle of the ordered data set is the $\lceil 15/2 \rceil=8$-th number which is 75.
- Find $Q_1$ and $Q_3$. $Q_1$ is the median of the numbers less than the median. $Q_3$ is the median of the number greater than the median. In this example, $Q_1$ is the 4-th number 69. $Q_3$ is the 4-th to the last, that is 79.
- $\text{IQR}=Q_3-Q_1=79-69=10$.
- Since $Q_1-1.5\text{IQR}=69-1.5\cdot 10=54$ and $Q_3+1.5\text{IQR}=79-1.5 \cdot 10=94$, there is no outlier in this sample.

## Box Plot

- A **box plot** shows a "five-number summary" of the data set. It contains a box, two whiskers and dots (for outliers).

- To create the boxplot for a distribution,
  
  - Draw a box from $Q_1$ to $Q_3$.
  
  - Draw a vertical line in the box at the median.
  
  - Extend a tail from $Q_1$ to the smallest value that is not an outlier and from $Q_3$ to the largest value that is not an outlier.
  
  - Indicate outliers with a solid dot.

---

## Example: Box plot - ages of best oscar winners (1/2)

Create the boxplot for the ages of 32 best actor oscar winners (1970–2001).

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'} 
cat(paste(sort(actor_age$Age), collapse=", "))
```
]

--

**Solution:** We may use Excel to find the five-number summary.

- The quartiles are 
  $$Q_2=42.5,\quad Q_1=37.5,\quad Q_3=49.5.$$
  The interquartile range and the bounds for mild outliers are
  $$\text{IQR}=12, \quad Q_1-1.5\text{IQR}= 19.5, \quad Q_3+1.5\text{IQR}=67.5.$$

- The smallest number that is not an outlier is 31. The largest number that is not an outlier is 61. Those two numbers bound the whiskers.

- The number 76 is a mild outlier because
  $$Q_3+1.5\text{IQR}< 76 < Q_3+3\text{IQR}.$$

---

## Example: Box plot - ages of best oscar winners (2/2)

**Solution: (continued)**

- The boxplot is shown below.

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis', fig.width=12, fig.asp=0.4} 
# load("Data-Frames-SUNY-Concepts-in-Statistics/actor.rdata")

boxplot1<-ggplot(actor_age, aes(x="", y=Age)) +
  # stat_boxplot(geom = "errorbar") +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size=5) +

# Mean and Standard Deviation

## Notations and Calculations about Mean

- Sigma notation: in math, we denote the sum of values  $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_n$ of a variable $x$ by $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i$ or simply by $\sum x$.

- The **population mean** is $\mu= \frac{\sum x}{N}$, where $N$ is the **population size**, i.e the number of elements in the population.  

    The notation $\mu$ reads as mu.

- The **sample mean** is $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum{x}}{n}$, where $n$ is the **sample size**. The notation $\bar{x}$ reads as $x$--bar.

---

## Example: Mean city mpg

Find the mean city mpg for a sample of 10 cars.
.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'} 
cat(paste(head(mpg$cty,10), collapse=", "))
```                      
]

--

**Solution:** The mean is

$$\bar{x}=\frac{18+21+20+21+16+18+18+18+16+20}{10}=18.6.$$

The mean mpg of the 10 cars is 18.6 mpg.

---

## Weighted Mean

- The weighted mean of a set of numbers $\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ with weights $w_1$, $w_2$, ..., $w_n$ is defined as  $$\frac{\sum w_ix_i}{\sum w_i}.$$

- The mean of a frequency table is weighted mean $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum f x}{n}$, where $x$ is an element with frequency $f$ and $n$ is the sample size.

---

## Example: Course overall grade

In a course, the overall grade is determined in the following way: the homework average counts for 10%, the quiz average counts for 10%, the test average counts 50% , and the final exam counts for 30%. What's the overall grade of the student who earned  92 on homework, 95 on quizzes, 90 on tests and 93 on the final.

--

**Solution:** The overall grade is the weighted mean

$$\frac{\sum w_ix_i}{\sum w_i}=\frac{0.1\cdot 92+0.1\cdot 95+0.5\cdot 90+0.3\cdot 93}{0.1+0.1+0.5+0.3}=91.6.$$

# use coor_fixed(ration=binwidth*dotsize*max frequency) to setup the right y axis height.
irisPL = irisPL + theme_bw() + coord_fixed(ratio=0.1*0.6*yheightSL)
# tweak the theme a little bit

)
# add more tick mark on x axis
irisPL = irisPL + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(sepalmin,sepalmax,0.1))
# add tick mark on y axis to reflect frequencies. Note yheightSL is max frequency.
irisPL = irisPL + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 1), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 1,1/yheightSL), labels=seq(0,yheightSL))
# remove x y lables and remove vertical grid lines

## Measure of Variation about Population Mean

- The **deviation** of an entry $x$ in a population data set is the difference $x-\mu$, where $\mu$ is the mean of the population.
  
- The **population variance** of a population of $N$ entries is defined as
  $$
    \text{VAR.P}=\sigma^2=\dfrac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}.
  $$

- The **population standard deviation** is
  $$
    \text{STDEV.P}=\sigma=\sqrt{\dfrac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}}.
  $$

---

## Measure of Variation about Sample Mean

- The **deviation** of an entry $x$ in a sample data set is the difference $x-\bar{x}$, where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the sample.

- The **sample variance** and **sample standard deviation** are defined similarly
  $$
    \text{VAR.S}=s^2=\dfrac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}, \qquad
    \text{STDEV.S}=s=\sqrt{\dfrac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}},
  $$
  where $n$ is the sample size.

- **Rounding rule:** for mean, variance and standard deviation, we keep at least one more digit than the accuracy of the data set.

**Note:** To measure the spread, one may also use the **mean absolute deviation**
$$MAD=\dfrac{\sum |x-\bar{x}|}{n}.$$
However, the standard deviation has better properties in applications.

## Example: Standard deviation - ages of oscar winners

Find the mean and standard deviation ages of a sample of  32 best actor oscar winners (1970–2001).

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'} 
cat(paste(sort(actor_age$Age), collapse=", "))
```
]

--

**Solution:** We use the Excel functions `AVERAGE()` and `STDEV.S()` to find the mean and sample standard deviation respectively.
The mean is `r round(mean(actor_age$Age),1)`. The sample standard deviation is `r round(sd(actor_age$Age),1)`.

## Mean and Standard Deivation under Linear Transformation

- When we increase values in a data set by a fixed number $c$, the standard deviation of a data set won't change. However, the mean increases by $c$ too.

- When we multiple values in a data set by a factor $k$, the mean and the standard deviation both scale by the factor $k$.

## The Empirical Rule

If a data set has an **approximately bell-shaped** distribution, then

1. approximately 68% of the data lie within one standard deviation of the mean.

2. approximately 95% of the data lie within two standard deviations of the mean.

3. approximately 99.7% of the data lies within three standard deviations of the mean.

## Chebyshev’s Theorem

For any numerical data set, at least $1−1/k^2$
of the data lie within $k$ standard deviations of the mean, where $k$ is any positive whole number that is at least 2.

## Example: Applications of the Empirical Rule

A population data set with a bell-shaped distribution has mean $\mu = 6$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 2$. Find the approximate proportion of observations in the data set that lie:

1. between 4 and 8;
2. below 4.

--

**Solution:** Apply the Empirical Rule, there are 68% of data lie between 6-2=4 and 6+2=8. Since the distribution is symmetric, then 34% of data lie between 4 and 6, and 34% of data lie between 6 and 8. Then there are only 50%-34%=26% of data lie below 4.

---

## Example: Applications of Chebyshev's Theorem

A sample data set has mean $\bar{x}=6$
and standard deviation $s = 2$. Find the minimum proportion of observations in the data set that must lie
between 2 and 10.

**Solution:** Apply Chebyshev's theorem, there are 75% of data are between $\bar{x}-2s=2$ amd $\bar{x}+2s=10$.
