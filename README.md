# Xaringan Slides for a Statistics Course at QCC

Those slides are created for a Statistics course. Some examples and exercises are inspired by examples and exercise which can be found in two OER textbooks [Concepts in Statistics](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-concepts-statistics/) and [Introductory Statistics](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/index.html).

The slides cover nine topics which can be found on my website [https://yfei.page/teaching/statistics/](https://yfei.page/teaching/statistics/).
